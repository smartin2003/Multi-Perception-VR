# 🎭 Multi Perception VR - Binocular Rivalry Experiment  

## 🧠 Overview  
Multi Perception VR is a **virtual reality research tool** designed to simulate **binocular rivalry**, a cognitive phenomenon where the brain alternates focus between two distinct images presented to each eye. This system is intended for use in **neuroscience and psychology research**, integrating **VR display technology** with an **EEG headset** for real-time brain activity analysis.

## 🎯 Project Goals  
✔️ **Binocular Rivalry Simulation** – Display two independent images to each eye with no overlap.  
✔️ **Dynamic Image Control** – Allow researchers to adjust image presentation, including quick flashes at controlled intervals (e.g., every 100ms).  
✔️ **EEG Integration** – Synchronize recorded brain activity with user responses.  
✔️ **User Interaction** – Implement a dual-button system to track perception shifts.  
✔️ **Research-Ready** – Develop a fully functional tool for cognitive neuroscience experiments.
